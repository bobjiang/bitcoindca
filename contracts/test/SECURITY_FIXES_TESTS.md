# Security Fixes Test Suite Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive test suite created for all critical and high severity security fixes applied to the DCA Crypto smart contracts.

## Test Files

### 1. SecurityFixes.test.ts
Main test file covering fixes C-1 through C-4, H-1, H-2, and H-5.

**Location:** `test/unit/core/SecurityFixes.test.ts`

### 2. OwnerTracking.test.ts
Detailed tests for owner position tracking integrity (H-3).

**Location:** `test/unit/core/OwnerTracking.test.ts`

---

## Test Coverage by Fix

### C-1: Owner Tracking on Position Creation

**Issue:** Position wasn't added to `_ownerPositions` array on creation, breaking `positionsByOwner()`.

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Should add position to owner's list immediately after creation
2. ✅ Should track multiple positions for same owner
3. ✅ Should update user position count correctly on creation

**Key Assertions:**
- `positionsByOwner()` returns correct position IDs
- `userPositionCount` increments properly
- Positions are immediately queryable after creation

---

### C-2: Position Transfer Limit Bypass Prevention

**Issue:** NFT transfers didn't check `maxPositionsPerUser`, allowing limit bypass.

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Should prevent transfer when recipient is at maxPositionsPerUser
2. ✅ Should allow transfer when recipient is below limit
3. ✅ Should prevent transfer of active (non-paused) positions

**Key Assertions:**
- Transfer reverts with `MaxPositionsPerUserExceeded` when recipient at limit
- Transfer succeeds when recipient below limit
- Active positions cannot be transferred (must be paused)

---

### C-3: Price Staleness Validation

**Issue:** `getTokenPrice()` didn't validate Chainlink data freshness.

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Should reject stale price data from oracle
2. ✅ Should accept fresh price data
3. ✅ Should use configurable staleness threshold

**Key Assertions:**
- Prices older than `maxStaleness` are rejected
- Fresh prices are accepted and returned correctly
- `maxStaleness` can be configured by admin

**Test Setup:**
- Uses `MockChainlinkAggregator` with controllable timestamps
- Default staleness: 1800 seconds (30 minutes)

---

### C-4: Deviation Calculation Symmetry

**Issue:** Price deviation calculated asymmetrically based on parameter order.

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Should calculate same deviation regardless of parameter order
2. ✅ Should use larger price as base for calculation
3. ✅ Should correctly identify prices within threshold
4. ✅ Should correctly identify prices outside threshold

**Key Assertions:**
- `validatePriceDeviation(A, B, threshold)` === `validatePriceDeviation(B, A, threshold)`
- Deviation uses `max(price1, price2)` as denominator
- Threshold checks work correctly in both directions

**Test Cases:**
- Equal prices → 0% deviation
- 10% difference → correctly calculated
- Within threshold → valid = true
- Outside threshold → valid = false

---

### H-1: Emergency Withdraw Delay Persistence

**Issue:** `resume()` reset `emergencyUnlockAt`, allowing infinite delay via pause/resume cycling.

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Should not reset emergency unlock timer on resume
2. ✅ Should allow emergency withdraw after delay even if resumed
3. ✅ Should prevent delay manipulation via pause-resume cycling

**Key Assertions:**
- `emergencyUnlockAt` persists after `resume()`
- Emergency withdrawal works after reaching original unlock time
- Multiple pause/resume cycles can't reset the timer

**Scenario Tested:**
1. Pause (sets unlock time)
2. Resume (timer persists)
3. Re-pause
4. Wait until original unlock time
5. Emergency withdraw succeeds

---

### H-2: Global Position Counter Reconciliation

**Issue:** `activeGlobalPositions` drifts when positions expire naturally.

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Should allow admin to reconcile active position count
2. ✅ Should prevent non-admin from reconciling
3. ✅ Should emit correct event on reconciliation

**Key Assertions:**
- Admin can call `reconcileActivePositions(newCount)`
- Non-admin calls revert with access control error
- `ActivePositionsReconciled` event emitted with (oldCount, newCount)

**Function Added:**
```solidity
function reconcileActivePositions(uint256 newCount)
    external
    onlyRole(Roles.DEFAULT_ADMIN)
```

---

### H-5: PositionStorage Access Control

**Issue:** Any DEFAULT_ADMIN could manipulate PositionStorage metadata.

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Should allow setting DcaManager address once
2. ✅ Should prevent setting DcaManager twice
3. ✅ Should prevent setting zero address as DcaManager
4. ✅ Should only allow DcaManager to call setPositionMetadata
5. ✅ Should only allow DcaManager to call removePositionMetadata
6. ✅ Should allow DcaManager contract to call restricted functions

**Key Assertions:**
- `setDcaManager()` can only be called once
- Zero address rejected
- After setup, only DcaManager contract can modify metadata
- Admin can no longer directly call metadata functions

**New Access Pattern:**
```solidity
modifier onlyDcaManager() {
    require(msg.sender == dcaManager, "Not DCA manager");
    _;
}
```

---

### H-3: Position Removal Validation

**Issue:** `_removeOwnerPosition()` could silently fail or corrupt arrays.

**Tests (in OwnerTracking.test.ts):**

#### Position Removal Correctness:
1. ✅ Should correctly remove position from owner list on cancel
2. ✅ Should maintain correct indices after removal
3. ✅ Should handle removing last position
4. ✅ Should update position count correctly on removal
5. ✅ Should correctly handle position removal via NFT transfer
6. ✅ Should maintain position list integrity after multiple operations
7. ✅ Should handle emergency withdraw similar to cancel

#### Position List Consistency:
8. ✅ Should never have duplicate position IDs in owner list
9. ✅ Should correctly report positions for multiple users

**Key Assertions:**
- Removing positions maintains array integrity
- No duplicates in position lists
- Indices remain valid after removals
- User isolation (no cross-contamination)

**Internal Validations Added:**
```solidity
require(indexPlusOne > 0, "Position not in owner list");
require(index < list.length, "Index out of bounds");
require(list[index] == positionId, "Index corruption detected");
```

### Helpers Used:
- `createDefaultPositionParams()`: Creates valid position parameters
- `getPositionIdFromTx()`: Extracts position ID from transaction receipt
- `getCurrentTime()`: Gets current block timestamp

### Mocks Used:
- `MockChainlinkAggregator`: Controllable price feed for testing staleness
- `MockERC20`: USDC/WBTC token mocks

---

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests should be run:
1. ✅ On every commit to main branch
2. ✅ On every pull request
3. ✅ Before any deployment
4. ✅ After any contract upgrade

**Recommended CI Configuration:**
```yaml
test-security-fixes:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  env:
    RUN_DCA_BEHAVIOR_TESTS: true
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Compile contracts
      run: npm run compile
    - name: Run security fix tests
      run: npm test -- test/unit/core/SecurityFixes.test.ts test/unit/core/OwnerTracking.test.ts
```

---

## Test Maintenance

### When to Update Tests:

1. **Contract Upgrades**: If DcaManager or PositionStorage are upgraded, verify tests still pass
2. **New Features**: Ensure new features don't break existing fixes
3. **Parameter Changes**: If system limits change, update test assertions
4. **Bug Discoveries**: Add regression tests for any new bugs found

### Adding New Tests:

Follow this structure:
```typescript
describe("Fix ID: Description", function () {
    it("should test specific behavior", async function () {
        // Setup
        const { contracts } = await loadFixture(deployBaseSystemFixture);

        // Action
        const tx = await contract.someFunction();

        // Assertions
        expect(result).to.equal(expected);
    });
});
```

## Coverage Report

After running tests, generate coverage:
```bash
RUN_DCA_BEHAVIOR_TESTS=true npx hardhat coverage --testfiles "test/unit/core/SecurityFixes.test.ts"
```

**Target Coverage:**
- ✅ DcaManager: 85%+ coverage
- ✅ PositionStorage: 90%+ coverage
- ✅ PriceOracle: 80%+ coverage

---

## Known Limitations

1. **H-3 Internal Function**: Cannot directly test `_removeOwnerPosition()` since it's private. Tests rely on indirect calls via `cancel()`, `emergencyWithdraw()`, and NFT transfers.

2. **Timestamp Manipulation**: Some tests use `evm_setNextBlockTimestamp` which may behave differently than production.

3. **Mock Dependencies**: Tests use mock oracle/tokens which may not capture all edge cases of real Chainlink feeds.
