## Running the Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
cd contracts
pnpm test
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions

1. **Review Mock Contracts**
   - The tests reference mock contracts (MockERC20, MockChainlinkAggregator, etc.)
   - These need to be created in `contracts/test/mocks/` directory
   - Reference the imports in the test files for required interfaces

2. **Implement Actual Contracts**
   - Use the tests as a specification for implementing the actual contracts
   - The tests define the expected behavior and interfaces
   - Tests can guide TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach

3. **Add Router Adapter Tests**
   - Create tests for UniV3Adapter, CoWAdapter, OneInchAdapter
   - Follow the same pattern as existing tests
   - Test adapter-specific functionality

4. **Add Treasury Tests**
   - Create tests for Treasury contract
   - Test multisig functionality
   - Test timelock operations
   - Test fee distribution

5. **Continuous Integration**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Enable coverage reporting with Codecov
   - Add test status badges to README

6. **Gas Optimization Tests**
   - Add gas benchmarking tests
   - Set gas limits for critical operations
   - Monitor gas usage in CI
